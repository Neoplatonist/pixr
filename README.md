Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neoplatonist/pixr.git
```

Either build the binary with `make build` or download the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/Neoplatonist/pixr/releases). Currently we only have a release for linux, but will add more binaries later. Add the binary to the cloned directory.

To use first build the frontend with

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Afterward either fill out the configs or use flags to attach the mysql database.

To start the server:

```bash
./pixr
```

```bash
./pixr -h

or

./pixr --help
```
